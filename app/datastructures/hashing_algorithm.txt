###Hashing Algorithm:
1. Calculation appiled to key to transform into address.
2. For numeric key, divide the key by number of avialble adrresses, n, and take a remainer.
    address = key mod n
3. For alphanumeric keys, divide the sum of ascii code in a key by the number of avalible
addresses , n, and take the remainder.
4. Folding method divides key into equal parts then addes the part together.
  - The telephone numer 01452 8345654, becomes 01+45+28+34+56+54=218
  - Depending on the size of the table may divide by some constant and take remainder.

<===  Similarities between numpy array and list ===>
1. Both are Mutable object.
2. Both are use for storing data.
3. Both can be indexed and iterated through loop.
4. We can do slicing operation for both.

<=== Difference between list and numpy array ===>
1. List are having container of different datatypes. Ex: [1,2.1,'a']
Vs
1. Array are having container for same datatype. Ex: [1,2,3]
2. By using list you can't do all mathematical operation.
Vs
2. By using array you can do all mathematical operation.
3. List is bulit-in so you dont have to install or import at all.
Vs
3. For using numpy array, you have to install and import it explicitly.

<=== Advantage of numpy array over list ===>
1. It's consume less memory
2. It's do all mathematical operation faster.
3. It's more convenient to use if you want to do mathematical operations.
